## Detailed Description
This simulation project involved importing an F1 car model into ANSYS Fluent and setting up a high-speed external flow analysis. The model was analyzed at a velocity of 350 m/s to study pressure distribution, velocity streamlines, and wake formation. Proper turbulence models were applied (k-ε and k-ω SST), and results were visualized using velocity vectors and surface pressure plots to evaluate drag zones and aerodynamic behavior.
