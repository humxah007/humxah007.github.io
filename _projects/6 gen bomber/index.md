## Detailed Description
The project focused on designing a next-generation stealth bomber featuring a delta-flying wing layout to minimize radar cross-section and maximize aerodynamic efficiency. OpenVSP was employed to create the initial aerodynamic model, optimizing for lift distribution and stability. The design included internal payload bays and blended wing-body structures. CATIA V5 was used to refine the model, adding structural details and rendering high-fidelity visuals.

## Analysis
The flying wing configuration was analyzed for its aerodynamic benefits, including reduced drag and increased lift-to-drag ratio. Stability and control were addressed through careful placement of control surfaces and consideration of center-of-gravity locations.

## Conclusion
The design achieved a balance between stealth, range, and payload capacity, demonstrating the viability of a delta-flying wing configuration for future bomber aircraft.
