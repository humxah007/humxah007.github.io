### Detailed Description
This project involved creating a detailed CAD model of a 6-axis robotic arm using CATIA V5, replicating the functionality of industrial manipulators commonly used in assembly and manufacturing. Each joint was carefully designed to allow rotational movements mimicking real-world robotic arms, enabling complex spatial maneuvers. The arm structure was optimized for balance and reach, with attention to minimizing material use while maintaining rigidity.

The design incorporated modular components including base, shoulder, elbow, wrist, and end-effector mounting interface, allowing for future integration of sensors or tools. This exercise enhanced understanding of multi-axis motion, joint constraints, and assembly relations within CATIA's environment, preparing the model for future motion simulation and control system integration.

### Analysis
A kinematic feasibility check was performed to ensure the full range of motion for each joint without interference. The workspace envelope was visualized to confirm the arm could cover a realistic industrial operational area, with joint limits aligned to typical servo motor capabilities.

### Conclusion
The successful design of a fully articulated 6-axis robotic arm model in CATIA V5 demonstrates proficiency in complex mechanical CAD design and foundational robotics concepts. This project sets a solid base for future enhancements such as dynamic simulation, control algorithm development, and physical prototyping.
