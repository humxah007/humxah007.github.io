# Detailed Description
This project focused on designing and implementing a humidity and temperature sensing system using an Arduino microcontroller paired with a DHT11 sensor. The sensor provided both humidity and temperature readings, which were processed in real-time by the Arduino and displayed on a connected screen.

The readings were validated and calibrated to ensure accuracy (within 2â€“5%), with the system effectively compensating for temperature effects on humidity measurements. The setup highlights the importance of environmental sensing in modern applications and provides a hands-on demonstration of embedded system design and sensor data visualization.

## Analysis
The DHT11 sensor's resistance-based humidity measurement was verified through repeated testing. Calibration steps confirmed consistent output within the expected accuracy range. The system's real-time performance and ease of use make it suitable for small-scale environmental monitoring.

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates the successful use of Arduino and sensor integration for real-time humidity and temperature monitoring. The experiment proves useful in educational, experimental, and basic environmental sensing applications.
