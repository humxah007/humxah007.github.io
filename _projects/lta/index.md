# Detailed Description
A lighter-than-air vehicle was constructed with a square balsa base. Cross-joined beams and vertical stands supported the upper frame. DC motors with propellers were mounted for lift, controlled via ESCs and a remote. Epoxy mixed with sand was applied to strengthen joints. The structure was tested for floatation and balance, achieving stable hovering indoors.
