## Detailed Description
This project focused on the design of a quadcopter capable of carrying a camera for surveillance or photography missions. The frame was modeled with central support arms extending symmetrically to four propeller hubs. A mounting bracket for a small camera was designed and positioned to avoid field-of-view blockage. The motor mounts, propeller design, and battery compartments were included in the model, ensuring mechanical balance and aesthetic alignment. Rendering was done in CATIA V5 to create realistic visuals of the final product.
