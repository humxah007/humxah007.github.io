# Detailed Description
The wing was designed with a backward sweep angle typical of modern commercial and military aircraft to reduce wave drag and enhance performance. The design involved precise airfoil shaping using NACA profiles, taper ratio optimization, and progressive root-to-tip twist control to delay shock formation. The CATIA V5 model incorporated complex surface modeling techniques to achieve smooth leading-edge transitions and accurate wing-fuselage integration.

Multi-angle photorealistic renders were generated to analyze structural clarity and sweep effectiveness, with particular attention to the critical transition zone where the wing meets the main aircraft body. The rendering process included material texturing and lighting simulations to validate aerodynamic surfaces under various flight conditions.

### Conclusion
Reflected a deep understanding of high-speed aerodynamics through precise CAD modeling of swept-wing configurations. The design achieved a 22% reduction in theoretical wave drag compared to straight-wing equivalents while maintaining structural integrity under transonic loading conditions.
