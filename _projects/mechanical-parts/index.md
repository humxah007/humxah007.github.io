## Detailed Description
This project consisted of designing individual mechanical components including a spur gear and a complex twisted part. The gear was created with exact tooth parameters using the mechanical design module, while the twisted part required surface modeling and multi-axis transformations. Renderings were generated to visualize assembly applications.

## Conclusion
Developed realistic mechanical parts showcasing a strong grip on mechanical CAD tools and design for manufacturability.
