# Detailed Description
This project involved writing CNC programs to engrave the letters 'H', 'A', and 'B' onto a square metal plate. Two font styles were implemented: a simple, straight-line font using only horizontal and vertical lines, and a complex 'Harry Potter' style font with intricate curves and details. Special attention was given to leaving adequate space on one side of the plate for clamping during machining, ensuring the engraving process did not interfere with the holding mechanism.

## Analysis
The simple font design facilitated straightforward tool paths and reduced machining time. The 'Harry Potter' font required advanced programming to handle curves and intricate details, showcasing proficiency in CNC coding and toolpath optimization.

## Conclusion
Successfully demonstrated the ability to program complex and simple font styles for CNC engraving, considering practical machining constraints and achieving high-precision results.
