# Detailed Description
The project involved modeling each major section of a turbofan engine: fan, compressor, combustor, turbine, and nozzle. All parts were designed individually and assembled to reflect a realistic jet engine configuration. The focus was on dimensional proportions, blade design, and structural symmetry. Rendering emphasized material finish and engine alignment.

# Conclusion
Achieved a detailed CAD representation of a turbofan engine that reflects both engineering knowledge and CAD design proficiency.
