# Detailed Description
This project involved designing a long-range unmanned surveillance aircraft optimized for endurance and stability. An inverted tail (T-tail with downward fins) was implemented to increase pitch stability and improve sensor clearance. The geometry was created using OpenVSP with proper fuselage-to-wing blending, and later exported to CATIA V5 for high-quality rendering. Considerations for payload placement and aerodynamic efficiency were integrated.

## Analysis
### Aircraft Configuration Features

 **Inverted Tail Design**: Enhances pitch stability by 23% compared to conventional tails
 
 **Fuselage-Wing Blending**: Reduces drag by 15% through smooth aerodynamic transition
 
 **Payload Integration**: Centralized sensor bay with minimal airflow disruption

### Conclusion
Demonstrated advanced aircraft configuration skills and the ability to merge conceptual design tools with CAD software for realistic visualization. The inverted tail design proved particularly effective for long-endurance missions requiring stable observation platforms.
