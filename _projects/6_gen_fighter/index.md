# Detailed Description
This project involved creating a conceptual design of a next-generation fighter jet featuring a delta wing configuration. OpenVSP was utilized to model the aircraft's aerodynamic surfaces, ensuring optimal lift-to-drag ratios and stability at high speeds. The design emphasized stealth features, such as internal weapon bays and angled surfaces to minimize radar cross-section. The model was then imported into CATIA V5 for detailed rendering, including surface refinement and visualization of structural components.

## Analysis
Aerodynamic analysis focused on achieving supercruise capabilities and high maneuverability. The delta wing design was chosen for its favorable high-speed performance and structural efficiency. Stealth considerations were integrated into the design, including edge alignment and surface continuity.

### Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrated the integration of aerodynamic modeling and detailed CAD rendering to conceptualize a 6th-generation fighter jet. The design balances stealth, speed, and agility, serving as a foundation for further development and simulation.
