<span style="font-size: 10px">UCAV design methodology from concept to final configuration</span>  

## Detailed Description
The UCAV project encompassed the full design process of a long-endurance, stealth-capable unmanned combat aerial vehicle. Starting from the selection of MQ-9 Reaper as the reference platform (score: 87.66), the project addressed military-grade design requirements including 48,000 ft service ceiling, 17-hour endurance, and a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of 12,000 lb.

The configuration used a turboprop engine in a rear-mounted pusher layout to reduce detectability and infrared signature. A NACA 2415 airfoil was chosen for balanced performance. The airframe was optimized for stealth using angled surfaces and radar-absorbent materials. The design also incorporated tricycle retractable landing gear, payload armaments on external hardpoints, and a dedicated ground control interface.

 **Propulsion Placement:** Aft-mounted propeller reduced heat and radar signatures
 
 **Material Optimization:** Stealth composites and angled geometry for signature suppression
 
 **Flight Envelope:** All mission phases modeled with validated performance parameters
