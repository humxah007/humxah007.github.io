## Detailed Description
This project involved creating a terminal-based Pac-Man game using C++. Core elements included player movement, ghost logic, point collection, and level layout. Custom functions were written to handle collisions, scoring, and display updates without any game engine, demonstrating strong logic-building capabilities.
