# Detailed Description
This project involved creating a 3D model of a Formula 1 car with an emphasis on structural realism and aerodynamic efficiency. The bodywork, front and rear wings, sidepods, and diffuser were all modeled in CATIA V5. Special attention was given to the suspension geometry and tire profile to match the real-world performance specs of F1 cars. Final rendering highlighted surface smoothness and form aesthetics.

## Conclusion
Achieved a high-fidelity 3D visualization of an F1 car that demonstrates solid understanding of motorsport design parameters and CAD proficiency.
