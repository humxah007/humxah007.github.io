# Detailed Description
The propeller was designed using airfoil cross-sections and twisted blade geometry to ensure realistic aerodynamic behavior. The hub and blades were modeled separately and assembled with defined angular pitches. Final rendering visualized rotational symmetry and material finish.

## Conclusion
Demonstrated ability to design rotating aerodynamic components with precision and visualization using CATIA V5.
