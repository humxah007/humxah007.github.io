# Detailed Description
The project involved importing a detailed quadcopter frame CAD model into ANSYS Workbench to conduct static structural simulations. Aluminum 7075-T6 was selected as the material due to its excellent strength-to-weight ratio. Loads were applied to simulate:

 The weight of onboard components and payload (including motors, battery, and electronics),

 Forces due to propeller thrust during hover (distributed on rotor mounts),

 External impact forces simulating crash scenarios.

Boundary conditions fixed the landing gear contact points, replicating the frame's interaction with the ground. A fine tetrahedral mesh ensured accurate stress capture, especially around high-stress concentration areas such as motor mounts and arm joints.

## Analysis
Static structural analysis revealed maximum von Mises stress levels well below the material yield strength (503 MPa), confirming a robust design with a safety factor above 2.5 under maximum load cases. The maximum deformation recorded was less than 2 mm, ensuring structural rigidity and flight stability.

Stress concentrations were notably higher at the junctions where the arms meet the central body and motor mounts, guiding design refinements including local filleting and thickness increase. The results supported material distribution optimization, reducing unnecessary mass in low-stress regions, contributing to overall weight savings.

## Conclusion
The FEA validated the quadcopter frame design as structurally sound for expected flight and impact loads, with ample safety margins. Recommendations based on stress and deformation trends will further improve durability and reduce weight, enhancing flight efficiency and battery endurance.

## Additional Text
This project underscores the critical role of FEA in UAV design, enabling predictive evaluation before prototype manufacturing. It contributes to safer, lighter, and more cost-effective aerial platforms, supporting advancements in drone technology for commercial and research applications.
